# Course design

We shouldn't just start randomly creating content. First, let's make sure we have a solid plan.


# Learning needs

## Target demographic

This workshop is intended for anyone who wants to learn about a few important information security concepts. We will learn about the risks and threats our organizations face and we will learn about security controls we can apply to mitigate them. 

Audience:

* Any organization, be it commercial, non-profit, govermental or otherwise.
* Anyone who wants to understand the processes we apply to mitigate risks.


## Organisational needs

In the twentyfirst century it's almost impossible to have zero risks or threats against your organization. From banks to telcos, from government to NGO, from huge multinational to tiny SMB: we all face threats.

To deal with these threats, personnel needs to be trained and prepared on a number of topics.

An organization may have any of the following needs:

- Fill skill gaps related to:
  - Risk management
  - Threat modeling
  - Risk assessment
  - Business continuity
  - Incident handling
- Regulatory commitments, which require specific skill sets in employees.
- Regulatory commitments, which require specific risk management activities.


## Personal needs

Our audience can have any of the following motivations to participate:

- Curiosity about information security.
- Professional commitment to learn about risk management, etc.

- Per learning objective, how will we achieve the objecive?

## End result of the training

After this workshop, attendees will have a foundational understanding of information security risk management. Attendees will have practiced with security controls, risk management strategies, threat modeling and incident response. 

Attendees will be able to take their first steps in performing essential risk assessment and management tasks on their own projects.


# Required prior knowledge

There aren't any real requirements!

- Attendees need to speak a common language for the duration of the workshop. 
- It helps if attendees are familiar with the story of *Jurassic Park*. üòÅ


# Practical requirements

Trainers running this workshop will need:

- A project or TV screen, for the presentations.
- A laptop, or other computer, with a browser to use the Markdown slide deck.
- A dry-erase board with pens, or a digital drawing board.
- Post-its, other tools for the attendees.

And of course we can have fun by adding *Jurassic Park* Lego props. 
Lego props may also be used to demonstrate the different (phyiscal) security controls; preventative, detective, corrective.


# Gaining feedback

It's a nice idea to prepare a Microsoft Forms, or Google Forms questionnaire where attendees can leave anonymous feedback.
