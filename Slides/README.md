# Slide decks

I suggest that we use an open source, markdown-based approach for making the slides. We're all used to Powerpoint and/or Keynote, but for this workshop I'd rather use something that can be used cross-platform, without licensing issues.


## Some ideas for tools

Marp apparently is rather popular. But [here's a whole list of tools](https://gist.github.com/johnloy/27dd124ad40e210e91c70dd1c24ac8c8) that we could use. 

Feel free to make suggestions!
