# Slide decks

I suggest that we use an open source, markdown-based approach for making the slides. We're all used to Powerpoint and/or Keynote, but for this workshop I'd rather use something that can be used cross-platform, without licensing issues.


# Naming convention

We will make a Markdown file per chapter, to ease the process of collaboration and to keep document complexity lower.

The naming convention for these files is as follows:

`<integer>[E]-<title>.md`

Spaces are replaced with underscores.

The optional "E" indicates the slide deck for an exercise that goes with the identified chapter number. For example:

* 7-Incident_response.md
* 7E-Incident_response.md

These two are the training content, or lecture, related to threat modeling followed by the slides for the group exercise.


# Some ideas for tools

Marp apparently is rather popular. But [here's a whole list of tools](https://gist.github.com/johnloy/27dd124ad40e210e91c70dd1c24ac8c8) that we could use. 

Feel free to make suggestions!
