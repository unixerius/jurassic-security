# Jurassic Security

This project will provide materials for a half, or full day security workshop. 

In this session, participants will: 

- Learn about security control types. 
- Learn about threats, risks and vulnerabilities.
- Learn about threat modeling.
- Practice with threat modeling.
- Learn about hardening and secure coding.
- Theorycraft hardening and secure coding. 
- Learn about incident response.
- Play an incident response game. 

All of this will happen through the lens of the world-famous book and movie [*Jurassic Park*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurassic_Park).

# Why Jurassic Park?

*Jurassic Park* is used as a frame of reference because most participants in this workshop are familiar with the story. And because it's awesome!

*Jurassic Park* is a perfect showcase of threats, vulnerabilities, risks and of failing security controls. It makes learning about information security concepts accessible to people who are completely new to the field. 


## Original inspiration

The idea for this project popped up when [Willem Keesman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/willem-k-b44a31273/) and [Tess Sluijter-Stek](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tsluyter) were joking around in a study group for ISC2's *Certified in Cybersecurity* exam.

We were discussing detering vs preventative security controls, wondering when exactly a wall or fence isn't just a preventative control, but also a deterant. A reference was made to "*A Jurassic Park fence!*", which got the ball rolling. 


# Our plans

First up, we will come up with a course design for the workshop, followed by an outline of the curriculum.

Based on these, we will create course materials, slides, exercises and supporting materials.
