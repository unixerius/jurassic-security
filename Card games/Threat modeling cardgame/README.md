# Additional cards for Dani's *Threat modeling cardgame*

[DaniÃ«lle Wagemakers](https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniellewagemakers/) created a card game to practice threat modeling. 

While the card game itself is proprietary, we still thought we'd create an expansion for it, loosely based on events and characters from the book.


# Card ideas

| Category | Name | Concept |
| -------- | ---- | ------- |
| Threat actor | Nerdy Denise | Insider threat with high privileges. |
| Threat actor | Raptor | Highly aggressive force of destruction. |
| Crown jewels | Personnel | Arguably a company's most valuable asset. |
