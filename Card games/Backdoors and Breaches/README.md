# Additional cards for *Backdoors and Breaches*

One of our ideas is to create an expansion for the [*Backdoors and Breaches* incident response card game](https://www.blackhillsinfosec.com/projects/backdoorsandbreaches/), by Black Hills InfoSec. 

We will create additional cards, to add character and flavor to the B&B game, loosely based on events and characters from the book.


# Card ideas

Here's a first few ideas!

| Category | Name | Concept |
| -------- | ---- | ------- |
| Initial compromise | "*See? nobody cares!*" | One of your employees is bribed. |
| Pivot and escalate | x | x |
| Persistence | "*Ah ah ah!*" | The sysadmin left a logic bomb. |
| C2 and Exfil | Shaving cream | The threat actor manages to steal physical assets. |
| Procedures | Backup generator | Any physical attack is lowered in severity. |
| Procedures | Documentation | The team can respond more efficiently to the incident. |
| Injects | "*It's a Unix system!*" | Unexpected help from a bystander. |
| Injects | "*Clever girl!*" | The threat actor manages to breach a second system. |
