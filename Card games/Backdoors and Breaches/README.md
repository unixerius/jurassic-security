# Additional cards for *Backdoors and Breaches*

One of our ideas is to create an expansion for the [*Backdoors and Breaches* incident response card game](https://www.blackhillsinfosec.com/projects/backdoorsandbreaches/), by Black Hills InfoSec. 

We will create additional cards, to add character and flavor to the B&B game, loosely based on events and characters from the book.
