# Additional cards for *Backdoors and Breaches*

One of our ideas is to create an expansion for the [*Backdoors and Breaches* incident response card game](https://www.blackhillsinfosec.com/projects/backdoorsandbreaches/), by Black Hills InfoSec. 

We will create additional cards, to add character and flavor to the B&B game, loosely based on events and characters from the book.

Here's [a nice, short article](https://cybergladius.com/creating-fun-cybersecurity-tabletop-exercises/) with some pointers about using B&B as training tool, and even for some compliance.

Here's [a few campaign ideas](https://github.com/AntiSyphon/BandBCampaigns), from AntiSyphon.

RedCanary [also made an expansion](https://redcanary.com/blog/backdoors-breaches-expansion-deck/), solid inspiration for us!


# Card ideas

Here's a first few ideas!

A few of these, with thanks to [JurassicSystems.com](https://jurassicsystems.com), an HTML5/JS reproduction of the systems interface from the *Jurassic Park* movie.

| Category | Name | Concept |
| -------- | ---- | ------- |
| Initial compromise | "*See? nobody cares!*" | One of your employees is bribed. |
| Initial compromise | "*Life finds a way.*" | 0-Day: despite EDR, AV and IPS, malware infects a privileged workstation.  |
| Initial compromise | `zebraGirl.jpg` | An employee browses adult materials on a work PC and gets infected with malware. |
| Initial compromise | `keycheck off; safety off` | Critical security controls were disabled by your employees. |
| Pivot and escalate | `access security` | The threat actor gains a privileged RBAC role. |
| Persistence | "*Ah ah ah!*" | The sysadmin left a logic bomb. |
| C2 and Exfil | Shaving cream | The threat actor manages to steal physical assets. |
| C2 and Exfil | "*You didn't stop to think...*" | Your developers have some cool shadow IT, which unfortunately opens you up to C2/Exfil. |
| Procedures | Backup generator | Any physical attack is lowered in severity. |
| Procedures | Documentation | The team can respond more efficiently to the incident. |
| Procedures | "*We spared no expense!*" | The team has ample budget to implement counter measures. |
| Injects | "*Clever girl!*" | The threat actor manages to breach a second system. |
| Injects | "*Holy sh*t, it's a dinosaur!*" | The team discovers the initial compromise by accident. |
| Injects | "*I can't see without my glasses!*" | An unexpected error in your logging system. |
| Consultants | "*It's a Unix system!*" | Unexpected help from a bystander. |
| Consultants | Sally Ettler | SME who will also help with hands-on physical fixes. |
